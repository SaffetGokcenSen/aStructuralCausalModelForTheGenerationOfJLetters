# aStructuralCausalModelForTheGenerationOfJLetters 

In this repository, there is the Python code for a structural causal model to 

generate J letters. The J letters are drawn as 28x28 images. The output of the 

code is in the compressed file "generatedJ.7z". The article briefly explaining 

the structural causal model and the related Python code snippets are given on 

this [link][theArticle].
